Sorting Algorithms Animations
==========================

A Java-based animation tool that visualizes and compares the behavior and performance of classic sorting algorithms, using a variety of input data scenarios.

##  Features

- **View animations** of the following sorting algorithms:
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Comb Sort
    
- **Test with different input types** to observe how each algorithm performs in varying contexts:
  - Random dataset
  - Few unique elements
  - Reversed order
  - Nearly sorted data
